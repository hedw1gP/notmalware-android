In fact, this can do almost nothing because `MainActivity.java` is still kind of empty. You can see this as my layout practice, ~~but it is very silly to use dozens of View to make gaps between views.~~

Maybe I will add more features, or maybe it will be the real malware... like [`trolllocker`](https://github.com/ycwei982/trolllocker).
